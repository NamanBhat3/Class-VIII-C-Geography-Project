      <div class="text"><ol type = "I"><li>Geothermal is a one of idea to produce electricity by using thermal energy (energy which is made by transferring heat energy to electricity) which is made by using the crust heat from the earth.</li>
      <li>The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat).</li>
      <li>Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is continuously produced inside the earth by core of the earth and transferred to crust by conduction.</li> 
      <li>People use geothermal system to generate electricity. The working is very simple the pipe is attached under deep crust length of (4000-6000m) then the pipe is connects to chamber where turbine is kept the turbine is connected to generator and another pipe which is connected to chamber is attached under deep crust. </li>
      <li>The water is released in pipes by hydraulically fracture  then the crust of the earth heat the water then water changes to steam and the steam pressure moves the turbine and when the turbines move it generates electricity which gets stored in the generator which is transferred by using transformers and when the steam condensed it turns into water and then the water is used again for generating electricity.</li>
      <li>It is the most effective way because the heat produced by core is unlimited in nature. Only 24 country which produces Thermal energy in world which are then these energy is transferred to 78 countries.</li> 
      <li>These reactor are only assembled near the boundary of tectonics plates because the heat produce is more.</li> 
      <li>There are also no production of radioactive waste thatâ€™s why it can be the next renewable generators in future which can take place of fusions reactors.</li></ol> </div>
